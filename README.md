Stores Sales Prediction Project
The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.
# Store_Sales_Project_1
This Model will predict the sales of each store

Problem Statement:
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

Workflow stages
The solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.

1.Question or problem definition.
2.Acquire training and testing data.
3.Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.
4.Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.
5.Model, predict and solve the problem.
6.Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.
7.Supply or submit the results.
The workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.

1.We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.
2.Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.
3.Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.
4.Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset.
